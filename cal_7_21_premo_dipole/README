This is the first data with source fixtures, premo sensor, non-rotated corner
dipole source.  In this setup, the source fixture was boosted up above the
black granite surface plate using wood blocks.  We later moved to the modified
source slider.

Different from later, we have the 'md' data pattern across the source
fixtures, not 'source'.  And no 'ld' for proper testing.

Rz axis zeroed?  I don't think so.
