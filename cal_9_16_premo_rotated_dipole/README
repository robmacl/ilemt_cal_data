Dipole-approximating source and Premo sensor.  First data in this
configuration with ld/md in all source fixtures.  This is also the
first data with continuous source off-axis compensation.

The performance of the dipole source with source fixtures is poor, but
this seems to be a real effect.  Repeated collection
cal_9_24_premo_rotated_dipole gives very similar results.
