cal_9_15_premo_cmu:
This is the dataset used in the calibration paper for the "concentric"
source.

cal_9_16_premo_rotated_dipole:
This dataset is used for the linearity test in the calibration paper,
since cal_9_24_premo_rotated_dipole does not have the axis sweeps.

cal_9_24_premo_rotated_dipole:
This is the "dipole approximating" dataset used for position accuracy
in the calibration paper (but not for the linearity test).
