Yet another try at premo rotated_dipole data, this time just the 'md' 'ld' in
the 6 source and sensor fixtures, no 'sweep' or 'source'.

I note that in the soZoutYup the cable comes out at the front of the source
fixture, toward the sensor, and there is considerable influence of the source
cable lay on the ilemt_ui radial position.  There was also ~45 um radial drift
during the 'ld' collection in that fixture, perhaps due to cable droop.  For
the others, the ilemt_ui drift was <10 um.
