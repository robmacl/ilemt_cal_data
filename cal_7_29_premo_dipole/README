Source: CMU corner dipole, non-rotated
Sensor: Premo

Data with source and sensor fixturings, with sensor fixture setup on the
adapted source slider, rather than the cal_7_21_premo_dipole setup on blocks
of wood.

And also redid stage Rz axis alignment, this time using the test indicator,
which has much lower force, so minimal pole deflection.  The Rz was out ~300
um.  Still possible that I disturbed Rz alignment by messing around with the
sensor during the data collection.
