File name format is:
    so<mapping>_se<mapping>_<other stuff>.dat

The mapping is from the from fixed fixture axes to the moving part of the
fixture (the "mover").  The fixture and mover axes are aligned in the fixture
null pose.  The fixture axes are also nominally aligned with the stage axes,
although misalignment in source->stage is absorbed into the stage fixture
transform.

The term "mover" reminds us that these are the axes of the moving part of the
fixture, which are are *not* aligned with either the source or sensor axes.
This large mismatch is absorbed into the source and sensor fixture transforms.

Representation of the axis mapping:
 -- "out" is a synonym for fixture +Y, which is always in the direction from
    source to sensor in the standard stage setup.  
 -- "up" is a synonym for fixture +Z, which is always physically "up", toward
    the ceiling.
 -- We represent the axis mapping by which mover axis is "out" and
    "up".  If the out/up axis is negative, then we use in/down.
 -- out/in always comes before up/down.  So YoutZup, YinZup, etc.


The idea is that you can look at the setup and quickly tell whether the setup
is correct by looking at which mover axes are out and up.

An example of the mapping ZoutYup:
	Fixture		Mover
____________________________________
	+X		-X
	+Y (out)	+Z (Z)
	+Z (up)		+Y (Y)		

From this mapping we can read off the out/up notation.  Ignore the fixture X,
which is implied by right hand rule.  Then (mover) Z is "out" and mover Y is
"up".


Only certain fixturings are supported by our fixtures:

Sensor:
	old name	new name
________________________________________________________________
	Z_rot		YoutZup		The home fixture
	X_rot		ZinYup		Rotated +90 degrees about stage X
	Y_rot		ZinXup		Additionally rotated +90 about stage Y

Source:
	new name
________________________________________________________________
	YoutZup		The home fixture
	XoutZup		Rotate +90 about Z
	ZoutYup		Flip sides so Z out
	XinYup		Flip and +90 about Z



For the calibration and test procedures we need multiple files in various
fixturings (test plans).  These are some useful combinations:

Source fixture files:
soYoutZup_seYoutZup_source.dat	The home fixture
soXoutZup_seYoutZup_source.dat	Rotate +90 about Z
soZoutYup_seYoutZup_source.dat	Flip sides so Z is out
soZoutYup_seYoutZup_ld.dat	" same fixture, different pattern
soXinYup_seYoutZup_source.dat	Flip and +90 about Z

Source input patterns:
source_pattern.dat
cal_bigdata_pattern.dat (_ld)


Sensor fixture files:
soYoutZup_seYoutZup_size.dat	Home (in source list also)
soYoutZup_seZinYup_size.dat	fixture X rotate +90
soYoutZup_seZinXdown_size.dat	add Y rotate +90

Sensor input patterns with (size):
cal_smalldata_pattern.dat (_sd)
cal_middata_pattern.dat (_md)
cal_bigdata_pattern.dat (_ld)

Sweep files:
soYoutZup_seYoutZup_sweep.dat	Sweep data, home fixtures

Sweep input patterns (choose either):
axis_sweep.dat			2mm XYZ x 2 degree Rz
axis_sweep_1_1.dat		1mm XYZ x 1 degree Rz
